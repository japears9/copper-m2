# Architecture

How the Copper State Labs app fits together. Each module adds a section at the
end (see [Adding a module](#adding-a-module)) when it changes how the app
works: new pages, tables or AI calls.

_Fictional — for educational use._

## The starter app (Module 0)

A Next.js app that builds, runs and deploys with **no environment variables**.
A Google AI Studio key is optional until a module needs one.

| Piece | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Pages | `app/` | `layout.tsx` sets the fonts and theme; `page.tsx` is the placeholder home page |
| Brand components | `components/copper/` | `Logo`, `SiteHeader`, `SiteFooter`, `ModeToggle` |
| UI kit | `components/ui/` (shadcn), `components/ai-elements/` (AI Elements) | The only UI libraries the app uses |
| Setup card | `components/setup-required.tsx` | `<SetupRequired service="ai" />`, shown instead of a page whose service isn't configured |
| Company catalog | `lib/copper/catalog.ts`, `lib/copper/data/catalog.json` | Product, plan and privacy facts from the Product Bible (Sections 3, 4, 8 and 10). Pages read prices and plan details from here instead of typing them (added in the Module 1 starter) |
| AI wrapper | `lib/ai/call.ts` | `callText` and `callObject`: every model call goes through these and is logged to the terminal |
| Models and prices | `lib/ai/models.ts`, `lib/ai/pricing.ts` | The approved Gemini models and their token prices |
| Module checks | `specs/module-N/`, `scripts/check.mjs` | Each module's spec, instructions, rubric and acceptance tests; `npm run check` runs them |

## Data flow

1. A user opens a page in `app/`.
2. Server code checks what's configured (`isAiConfigured()`). If the key is
   missing, the page renders `<SetupRequired />` instead of crashing.
3. Data comes from files under `lib/copper/data/`, except where a module has
   moved it to a database: Module 2 part 2 moves stock to a Supabase
   `inventory` table, read through `lib/copper/inventory.ts`. Facts that don't
   change daily (prices, colors) stay in the files.
4. AI requests go through `callText` / `callObject` in `lib/ai/call.ts`, which
   calls Google and then prints one `[ai_calls]` line: `module`, `feature`,
   `model`, tokens, `cost_usd`, `latency_ms`, `ok`.

```ts
const { text } = await callText(
  { module: 2, feature: "ask-copper" },
  { prompt },
);
```

## Two kinds of "AI tiers"

Don't mix these up:

- **Copper State Labs' product tiers** (On-device, Raw Ore, Refined, the
  Copper Cloud) are part of the fictional company. They are facts in the
  [Product Bible](copper-state-labs/product-bible.md) and rows in the `ai_tiers`
  table.
- **The models this app calls** are real Claude models listed in
  `lib/ai/models.ts`. Their cost is logged in `ai_calls`.

## Decisions

- **No environment variables required.** Every service is optional, so a fresh
  clone builds and deploys before any accounts are set up.
- **One AI wrapper.** Routing every call through `lib/ai/call.ts` gives one
  place to log cost and latency per module and feature.
- **No authentication or row-level security yet.** They arrive in a later
  module.

## Adding a module

When a module changes how the app fits together, add a section here:

```md
## Module N: <feature name>

**Summary:** one or two sentences: what this adds and why.

| Piece | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Page / route | `app/...` | |
| Components | `components/...` | |
| Data | `lib/copper/data/...` | Data files added |
| AI calls | `lib/ai/call.ts` (module, feature) | Model, prompt purpose, expected cost per call |

**Data flow:** user action → page → server code → database / model → response.

**Decisions and trade-offs:** what you chose, the alternatives, and why.

**Risks and open questions:** cost, privacy, accuracy or safety risks, and how
you handle them.
```

## Module 2: Ask Copper

**Summary:** a floating chat panel that answers price, cost and stock questions
by calling four read-only tools instead of guessing, and shows each step
(thinking, tool calls, reply) as it streams in. A tools-off chat answers the
same questions from memory, for comparison.

| Piece | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Page / route | `app/page.tsx` | Still the only page. Mounts `<AskCopper aiConfigured={isAiConfigured()} />`; no new routes |
| Components | `components/copper/ask-copper.tsx`, `components/copper/tool-card.tsx` | The launcher, the Sheet panel with its two chats, the answer stations and the always-open tool card. The header gains an **Ask Copper** link to `#ask` |
| Tools | `lib/copper/assistant/tools.ts` | `get_products`, `get_prices`, `calculate_cost`, `check_availability`, with zod input contracts. Prices come from the catalog; stock is read with `readInventory()` on every call |
| Instructions | `lib/copper/assistant/instructions.ts` | `COPPER_INSTRUCTIONS`, the system prompt, sent only with tools on |
| Server Action | `lib/copper/assistant/ask.ts` | `askCopper({ messages, useTools })` returns a live `Progress` straight away and fills it in from `result.fullStream` |
| Data | Supabase `inventory` table | The stock list, read through `lib/copper/inventory.ts` |
| AI calls | `callStream` in `lib/ai/call.ts` (module 2, `ask-copper`) | The default Gemini model with thought summaries; up to 5 steps with tools on. Well under a cent per question |

**Data flow:** the shopper asks a question → the panel calls the `askCopper`
Server Action with that chat's history → `callStream` sends it to Gemini (with
instructions and tools, or with neither) → each tool runs in our code and its
result goes back to the model → every stream part updates the `Progress`,
which the panel reads with `readLive()` and redraws.

**Decisions and trade-offs:** a Server Action instead of an API route keeps the
site to one page. Each update is a fresh copy of the whole `Progress`, so a
missed update loses nothing and earlier ones never change. Tools on and off are
separate chats, so the tools-off model can't copy an answer the tools worked
out.

**Risks and open questions:** the tools only read, so the model can't buy or
change anything. The request is validated with zod, since anyone can call a
Server Action. With tools off, answers may be made up; the panel labels them
"Answered without tools". There's no rate limiting yet, so a busy public site
could run up AI cost.
